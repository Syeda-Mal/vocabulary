## Installation

It is absolutely important to install prettier as a dev dependency for this project

First, install Prettier locally:

_with npm_

```bash
 npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
```

_with yarn_

```bash
 yarn:   yarn add --dev --exact prettier
```

Instailling with `npm` is lightweight, tweakable and much more performant as the code runs very close to the operating system.

#### Formatting with Prettier

Now, you can go ahead and format all files with Prettier:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

If you want to format just a particular directory, You may run

```bash
prettier --write src/footer
```

or if you want to format a particular file

```bash
prettier --write src/components/buttons/button.scss
```

## Ignoring Files

Create a .prettierignore file to let the Prettier CLI and editors know which files to not format.
You can base your .prettierignore on the existing .gitignore file
